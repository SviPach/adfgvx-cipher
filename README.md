# ADFGVX Cipher

## Description

**ADFGVX Cipher** is a classical encryption algorithm used by the German Army during World War I. It combines a Polybius square with a columnar transposition cipher, allowing for the encryption of 36 characters (26 letters and 10 digits). The cipher is named after the six letters used in the Polybius square: A, D, F, G, V, and X.

This project is a Windows Forms application developed in C# that implements the ADFGVX cipher for educational purposes.

## Features

- **Encryption and Decryption**: Securely encrypt and decrypt messages using the ADFGVX cipher.
- **Graphical User Interface**: User-friendly interface built with Windows Forms for ease of use.
- **Customizable Key**: Allows input of custom keys for encryption and decryption processes.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that inputs are valid and formatted correctly before processing.
